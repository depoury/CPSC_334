## Project 3 - Wireless Smoke Detector
I started with the idea of building a smoke detector as my DIY sensor.
To this end, I put an LED next to an LDR in a dark space and took a measurement from the LDR to establish a baseline.

When smoke enters the chamber, it will reduce the amount of light that reaches the LDR, thus sensing smoke.
